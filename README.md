# Coffee Maker Project

This is a simple command-line Coffee Maker program built in Python. The project allows users to order different types of coffee, checks if there are sufficient resources, processes payments in INR, and updates the available resources accordingly.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main files:

1. `coffee.py` - The main Python script that handles user interaction, coffee selection, payment, and resource management.
2. `data.py` - A file containing the `MENU` and `resources` dictionaries that store information about the types of coffee available and the initial resources.

## How to Run the Program

1. **Clone the repository**: Make sure you have both `coffee.py` and `data.py` files in the same folder named `coffee_maker`.
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pooja389/coffee_maker.git
2. **Navigate to project directory**:cd coffee_maker
3. **Run the coffee.py scripy**:python coffee.py
